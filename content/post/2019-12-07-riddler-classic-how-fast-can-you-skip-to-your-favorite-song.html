<h2>How Fast Can You Skip to Your Favorite Song?</h2>
<p>In this week’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fast-can-you-skip-to-your-favorite-song/">FiveThirtyEight Riddler Classic</a> we are asked for the optimal strategy to play song number <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/answer-life-universe-and-everything-sum-three-cubes-mathematics-0910">42</a> on your 100-song playlist, starting from a random position, with only “next song”, and “random song” buttons. Also, on average how many clicks will you need to get to that song?</p>
</div>
<div id="proposed-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>We set r between 0 and 0.5 as the breakpoint above which we use the “next” button. We always use the random key if the current position is between 43 and 100.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Number of key presses} = random + next = \frac{1}{0.42-r} + \frac{0.42-r}{2}\dot{}100
\]</span>
The number of “random” clicks is the reciprocal of the probability of falling in the range. The number of “next” key presses is (0.42 - r)*100, which needs to be divided by two because the expected value would be in the middle of the range.</p>
<p>Setting the first derivative to zero to minimize, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{(0.42-r)^{2}}-50 =0
\]</span></p>
<p>Which has a root at 0.2785, which we round to 0.28, or song 28. Accordingly, we should hit the random key unless the current song is between 28 and 42.</p>
<p>Let’s simulate this strategy with one million trials, and look at the distribution of results and the average number of clicks needed by following this strategy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

playlist &lt;- function(rounds=100){
  
  results &lt;- matrix(NA, ncol=3, nrow = rounds)
  colnames(results) &lt;- c(&#39;origin&#39;, &#39;arrows&#39;, &#39;randoms&#39;)
  
  for (i in seq_len(rounds)) {
    original_position &lt;- sample.int(n = 100, size = 1)
    random_clicks &lt;- arrow_clicks &lt;- 0
    results[i, 1] &lt;- original_position
    
    while ((original_position &gt; 42) | (original_position &lt; 28))  {
    
        random_clicks &lt;- random_clicks + 1
        original_position &lt;- sample.int(n = 100, size = 1)
      }
    arrow_clicks &lt;- (42 - original_position)
    results[i, 2:3] &lt;- c(arrow_clicks, random_clicks)
    }
  return(as.data.frame(results))
}

plays &lt;- playlist(1000000)

plays_sum &lt;- plays %&gt;% group_by(origin) %&gt;%
  summarize(arrows=mean(arrows), randoms=mean(randoms))
  
plays %&gt;% summarize(round(mean(arrows+randoms),3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   round(mean(arrows + randoms), 3)
## 1                           12.669</code></pre>

<h2>Plotting the Results</h2>

<p>The chart shows the number of clicks of the next and random keys from every starting position. When you are below, but within 14 songs of 42, the random key is not used. It takes on average about 12.7 total key presses to get to song <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42">42</a>! If you had both a “next” and “previous” key, it would only take 9 key pressses on average.</p>

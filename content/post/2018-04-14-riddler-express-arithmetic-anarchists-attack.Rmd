## *On the April 6, 2018 FiveThirtyEight Riddler Express*

[The Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) is the excellent math and logic puzzle weekly by Oliver Roeder. Puzzles are posted every friday, together with the solutions to the previous week's puzzles.  I occasionally submit proposed solutions, using R whenever possible.  Yesterday Ollie was kind enough to give me a [shout out](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-find-the-perfect-poker-hand-can-you-shut-this-infernal-box/) for the ggplot chart that I provided together with my solution to the previous week's [Riddler Express](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-will-the-arithmetic-anarchists-attack/). This is a brief post going over my submission code, please refer to Ollie's post for the puzzle description. The puzzle can be solved with just 16 lines of R code. 


## R Code to Evaluate All 21st Century Dates

```{r century, message=FALSE}
library(zoo); library(tidyverse)

mydate <- as.Date('2001-01-01')
i <- 1; results <- matrix(nrow=212,ncol=3)
repeat {
mymonth <- as.numeric(format(mydate,'%m'))
myday <- as.numeric(format(mydate,'%d'))
myyear <- as.numeric(format(mydate,'%y'))

if (mymonth*myday == myyear) {results[i,1] <- as.Date(mydate); i<-i+1}

mydate <- mydate+1
if (mydate==as.Date('2100-01-01')) break
}
# Get year of each attack
results[,2] <- as.numeric(format(as.Date(results[,1]),'%Y'))

# Get gaps between dates
results[2:212,3] <- diff(results[,1])
```


### How Many Attacks Will Happen?
nrow(results): `r nrow(results)`

### What Year Will Have the Most Vandalism?
names(sort(table(results[2:212,2]), decreasing = T)[1]): `r names(sort(table(results[2:212,2]), decreasing = T)[1])`

How Many?
sort(table(results[2:212,2]), decreasing = T)[1]: `r sort(table(results[2:212,2]), decreasing = T)[1]`

### What Year Will the Least Vandalism? Multiple Years Have No Attacks, See Chart Below

### What is the Longest Gap Between Attacks?
max(results[2:212,3]): `r max(results[2:212,3])` days

### What is the Shortest Gap Between Attacks?
min(results[2:212,3]): `r min(results[2:212,3])` days

## Plot Results
```{r results, message=FALSE}
res <- as.data.frame(results)
colnames(res) <- c('date','Year','Count')
res <- res %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarize(Count=n())
bc <- data.frame(Year=2001:2099)
bc <- left_join(bc,res)
bc[is.na(bc$Count),'Count']<-0
bc$Count<-as.factor(bc$Count)

ggplot(bc,aes(x=Year,y=Count)) +geom_col(aes(fill=Count)) +theme_classic() +scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set1') +
  ggtitle('Anarchist Attacks by Year',subtitle = '212 Anarchist Attacks in Century')
```

Twitter user @Cardlinger commented on the fact that the y axis seems to start at a negative value.  This allows for "zeros" on the chart to be clearly distinguished. Otherwise, with 99 bars, the small gaps between gaps caused by zeros would be difficult to identify.
